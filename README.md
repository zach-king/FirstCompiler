# My First Compiler
My first compiler, created with the aid of ["Let's Build a Compiler" by Jack Crenshaw](http://www.stack.nl/~marcov/compiler.pdf).
Nothing special and definitely going to be a slow WiP (Work in Progress).

**Note:** The *cradle.pas* (Pascal) file in this root directory stands as the "base file" mentioned in
the book. However, the real additions to the compiler are found in their corresponding chapter
directory, such as chapter 2 which adds the basic arithmetic.
